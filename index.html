<strong>Factor Investing in Corporate Bond Mutual Funds</strong><br>
<em>Job Market Paper</em><br>
<p>
Abstract: “Despite the widely recognized importance of factors in asset pricing and the rapid growth of factor investing, we know little about how factors operate 
  in the corporate bond market. Using detailed portfolio holdings for US corporate bond mutual funds, I provide novel evidence on their factor exposures and link 
  them to performance at both the bond-holding and fund levels. I show that funds generally tilt their portfolios against well-known academic factors, and these 
  contrarian tilts are highly persistent. This behavior may reflect the limited presence of factor premia in the bond market. However, using holdings-based fund 
  returns, I find positive premia for the bond-traded liquidity factor in the full sample. Additionally, bond momentum and duration deliver negative premia, credit
  risk earns positive premia in investment-grade fund holdings, and stock momentum generates positive premia in high-yield fund holdings. Despite these factor premia, 
  funds that tilt toward the factors underperform peers that tilt against them. Implementation frictions and heterogenous asset allocations, such as cash, Treasuries, 
  and Rule 144A bonds, significantly offset the benefits of factor tilts at the fund level. Overall, these findings indicate that the practical value of factor investing
  in the bond market is limited and often eroded by the costs associated with liquidity management and heterogeneous asset allocations.”

<strong>Mutual Fund Tournament and ESG Ratings</strong>
<em>with Fabio Moneta </em><br>
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5619190">SSRN</a>
<p>
Abstract: “We document a novel form of tournament behavior based on ESG: U.S. equity growth fund managers use Morningstar’s ESG Risk Ratings (measured by a five-globe system)
  as a competitive tool to attract investor flows. We provide evidence of a causal link between past performance and ESG tilts: funds that underperform early in the year 
  strategically rebalance toward higher-rated ESG stocks and sell non-ESG stocks to improve their sustainability ratings by year-end. These portfolio tilts do not enhance 
  financial returns or environmental outcomes, yet investors reward them: underperforming funds that succeed in raising their globe ratings experience smaller outflows than
  those that do not. A similar pattern emerges among European growth funds, though the tournament centers on Morningstar’s Low Carbon Designation. Our findings raise ethical
  concerns that such ESG tilts may reflect agency-driven incentives rather than a genuine commitment to investors’ interests or sustainable impact.”

<strong>Retail Investor and Stock Return Predictability</strong><br>
<em>with Fabio Moneta </em><br>
<p>
Abstract: “Inspired by the influential work of Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021), we re-examine the predictability of retail order flow for stock returns using a novel
  and more accurate retail trading database (VandaTrack) over an extended sample period from 2014 to 2022. We find that the predictability of retail trading persists for up 
  to five weeks from 2014 to 2016, a window that overlaps with Boehmer et al., but is absent out of sample from 2017 to 2022. The predictability observed in 2014-2016 is 
  concentrated in small stocks when buying strongly dominates selling. The predictability for small stocks is seriously weakened because of the improvement in liquidity in 
  the later period. Once we exclude small stocks with low liquidity, the remaining retail order flow lose predictability even in 2014-2016. This paper provides evidence that
  liquidity is an important factor explaining the decline in predictability of retail trading rather than informed trading.”
